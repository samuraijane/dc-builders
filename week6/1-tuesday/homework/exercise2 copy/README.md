# Homework Exercise 2
Create a _Contact Us_ form that allows a user to provide contact information to a vendor.

## Requirements
1. Name the form _Contact Us_ using `<legend>` inside of `<fieldset>`
2. Include text inputs for _Name_ and _Email_
3. Include a dropdown (i.e. `<select>` with various `<option>` elements) that denote the user's native language
4. Provide at least 3 languages from which to choose
5. Include a `<textarea>` element where the user can share some additional details
6. Remember that `<textarea>` elements do not use `<label>` but be sure to precede the area with something that informs the user of the type of content that is expected.
