# Exercise 1 - Test Driven Development Practice

For each of the following word problems, your mission is to code a JavaScript function that performs the desired action using the Test Drive Development (TDD) workflow we reviewed in class. Write a test first, then try to write the function.

`Red -> Green -> Refactor -> Repeat!`

You can have one NPM project for all of these problems, but for each, make a separate JS module file and test suite file.

## Problem 1 - Leap Year Checker

Write a funciton that returns a boolean indicating if a given year is a Leap year. Assume the year is provided as an integer.

[Leap Year Rules](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html)

Example inputs:
* `2001` -> Not a leap year
* `2004` -> Leap Year
* `2000` -> A Leap Year
* `2100` -> Not a Leap Year
* `2400` -> Leap Year

## Problem 2 - Days in the Month Calculator

Write a function that takes in the name of a month and the year, then returns the number of days in that month. Take leap years into consideration. Years and months are both provided in integers

Example inputs:
* `1`, `2001` -> January 2001 had 31 days
* `2`, `2001` -> February 2001 had 28 days
* `2`, `2004` -> February 2001 had 29 days
* `11`, `2020` -> November 2020 has 30 days
* `13`, `2020` -> Not a valid month!

_Hint_: Use the function you created above! 

## Problem 3 - Bowling Score Calculator

You're building something like [BowlingGenius](https://www.bowlinggenius.com/) to calculate bowling scores online. Write a function that takes in an Array of bowling scores for each frame and computes the result. Assume all inputs are strings and the output is an integer.

A broad summary of bowling rules:
* There are ten frames
* Each frame has two chances to knock down 10 pins
* Knocking down all the pins on the first try is a strike ('X')
* Knocking down the remaining pins on the second try is a spare ('/')
* When you get a strike, the next *two* scores are counted as part of the current frame
* When you get a strike, the next *one* score is counted as part of the current frame
* If you get a strike in the tenth frame, you get two more attempts
* If you get a spare in the tenth frame, you get one more attempt

[Complete scoring rules here.](http://www.fryes4fun.com/Bowling/scoring.htm)

Example inputs:

* `['1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1']` 1 pin each frame (score = 10)
* `['/', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0',]` One spare and one 5 (score = 20)
* `['X', '5', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0',]` One spare and one 5 (score = 30)
* `['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X']` Strike each frame (score = 300)
* `['W', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0',]` Invalid!!
