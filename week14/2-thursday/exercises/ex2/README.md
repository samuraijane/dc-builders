Take the data you capture in ex1 and POST it to /books

Things to keep in mind
* You need and Express server running
* You will need the body-parser dependency in addition to express
* You will need to define an endpoing for /books
* Don't forget to add the middleware for body-parse so you can get at the data that comes through
* Create a start script in package.json
* Use fetch or another HTTP method in the client to send the data to the server
