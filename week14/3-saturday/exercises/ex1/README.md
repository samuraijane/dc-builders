Steps

database server is running
you have the necessary dependecies to talk to your database in package.json
you have a table called library
the library database has a table called author with data type string
(at this point you are done with the database side of things)
you have imported your dependencies into server.js
you have created a database connection in server.js
run the npx command that creates the model Author with the fields that correspond to the Author table columns
you should now have a models directory
create an api directory
inside this direcotry, create authorApi.js
this is where you will create your endpoint
