## Agenda
1. Build the ACME Bank application

## Learning Objectives
1. Learn the basics of Redux (the entire time in class today will be spent following along with class demo)

## References
1. [Basic Tutorial in Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial)
1. [Redux in the Learning Portal](https://learn.digitalcrafts.com/flex/#_20-redux) (This has way more information that we are covering and although we have added it here as a reference, the Basic Tutorial in Redux is aligned more with what we will do today.)

## Highlights
1. `react-router-dom`, `react-redux` and `redux` are required
1. `mapStateToProps` to add data from the Redux store to a component's props
1. `mapDispatchToProp` to add functions that trigger reducers to a component's props
1. Export components that need access to the Redux store with `connect`
1. Each reducer is responsible for only a slice of state
1. Actions must have a value for `type` and almost always have a `payload` object

## Homework
1. Build [dynamic drop down menus](../homework/README.md)
