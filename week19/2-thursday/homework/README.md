# Week 19 Homework - Props practice and Class-based components.

Using `create-react-app`, create a new React application for an online tic-tac-toe. The site should consist of the following _class-based_ components.

* App
    * Board
        * Square
    

You goal is to render the tic-tac-toe board using the above components from a JavaScript array representing the board state that exists in the Game.js file. An example is below:

```javascript
const board = [
    ['', 'X', 'X'],
    ['', 'O', 'O'],
    ['', 'X', 'O'],
];
```

Please us e icons or images for the X's and O's, as well as whatever layout technique you want for the grid (like bootstrap grid).

Tips:
* Don't use the default components created by the CLI.
