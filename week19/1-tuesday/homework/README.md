# Week 19 Homework

Using `create-react-app`, create a new React application for a blog site. The site should consist of four components, in the following heirarchy:

* Blog
    * Header
    * Article
    * Footer

You should use bootstrap to style the elements appropriately. Don't spend time making it look pretty - just using bootstrap items is sufficient. You should use some dummy placeholder text for the content.

Tips:
* Don't use the default components created by the CLI.
