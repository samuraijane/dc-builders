// Time to tie all of your classes together! script.js is going to control the gameplay itself:

// - When the page loads, prompt the user for the name of the Hero and the name of the Villain
// - Create a new Hero and a new Villain, render them to the screen
// - Create two new Weapons, and have the Hero and Villain each equip one
// - Provide two buttons on the screen: one that will let the Hero attack the Villain and another button that will let the Villain attack the Hero
// - When the Hero's health goes below 1, show "Game over"
// - When the Villain's health goes below 1, show "Victory!"

$(function () {
  function myHero() {
    let hero = prompt();
  }
});
